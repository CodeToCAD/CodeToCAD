## What is CodeToCAD

## Why CodeToCAD?

âœ… Simplified modeling interface - it's all text! No more scrolling and clicking into sub-menus to edit your models.

ðŸ”“ Not vendor locked - your models are created in an open-source language. If you want to use another software, you do not lose the features you have defined. Note: There is no guarantee that a model created for, e.g. Blender, will work right away for another software, but with some refactoring, it theoretically should!

ðŸª¶ Lightweight and portable. All you need is a text-editor to model. You can occasionally fire-up your modeling software to run your creations.

ðŸ’ª Leverages existing programming languages, like Python. You can keep using the languages you're familiar with and love. There is no one-off language you and your team has to learn. Use CodeToCAD like a library or a framework.

ðŸš¦Easy version control. Your models are written in code, you can use industry-loved git to keep track of versions of your models.

ðŸ’• Built by people who believe in automation and that modeling workflows should be intuitive, reliable and most importantly free and open source!

## Getting started

> Pre-requisites: [Python 3.10 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Install the [CodeToCAD PIP Package](https://pypi.org/project/CodeToCAD/) to get intellisense syntax highlighting.

   ```
   pip install CodeToCAD
   ```

2. Create your own CodeToCAD python file and save it ([docs](https://codetocad.github.io/CodeToCAD/docs.html)):

   ```python
   # my_codetocad_script.py
   # More examples can be found under CodeToCAD/examples/
   from codetocad import *

   my_material = Material("material").set_color(169, 76, 181, 0.8)
   Part("Cube").create_cube(1, 1, 1).set_material(my_material)
   ```

3. Watch as your code gets seemlessly translated into CAD using our [custom addon](#working-with-the-software-of-your-choice) for your desired application

> Above is the above script being run in blender using our [Blender Addon](#blender) below.

## Working with the software of your choice
> Remember to first follow the getting [started instructions](#getting-started)
### Blender
> Pre-requisites: Blender 3.1 or newer is required.

1. Download a release of the Blender Addon from [CodeToCADBlenderAddon.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeToCAD/CodeToCAD/develop/CodeToCADBlenderAddon.zip) or from the latest [release](https://github.com/CodeToCAD/CodeToCAD/releases)
   > Note for developers: instead of downloading a release, you can clone this repository, then watch this guide to get set up - [Video Guide](https://youtu.be/YD_4nj0QUJ4)

2. Install the Blender Addon in the blender software
![import_file](/docs/images/Blender_Install_Addon.gif)

3. Import your script using the file menu > import > CodeToCAD or the CodeToCAD menu in the sidebar.
   ![import_file](/docs/images/import_file_in_blender.png)

> Warning: Since CodeToCAD scripts are written and executed in Python, be careful when running scripts you find on the internet!

> Note, you can also run CodeToCAD in Blender via cli: `blender -- --codetocad $(pwd)/yourScript.py`

### Onshape
