## What is CodeToCAD
CodeToCAD is an open source code-CAD automation. It provides extendable, declarative and imperative interfaces that allow engineers and developers to write code-CAD scripts that can be checked into source control, collaborated on, and run on any supported 3D modeling software.

## Why CodeToCAD?

‚úÖ Simplified modeling interface - it's all text! No more scrolling and clicking into sub-menus to edit your models.

üîì Not vendor locked - your models are created in an open-source language. If you want to use another software, you do not lose the features you have defined. Note: There is no guarantee that a model created for, e.g. Blender, will work right away for another software, but with some refactoring, it theoretically should!

ü™∂ Lightweight and portable. All you need is a text-editor to model. You can occasionally fire-up your modeling software to run your creations.

üí™ Leverages existing programming languages, like Python. You can keep using the languages you're familiar with and love. There is no one-off language you and your team has to learn. Use CodeToCAD like a library or a framework.

üö¶Easy version control. Your models are written in code, you can use industry-loved git to keep track of versions of your models.

üíï Built by people who believe in automation and that modeling workflows should be intuitive, reliable and most importantly free and open source!

## Getting started

> Pre-requisites: [Python 3.10 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Install the [CodeToCAD PIP Package](https://pypi.org/project/CodeToCAD/) to get intellisense syntax highlighting.

   ```
   pip install CodeToCAD
   ```

2. Create your own CodeToCAD python file and save it ([docs](https://codetocad.github.io/CodeToCAD/docs.html)):

   ```python
   # my_codetocad_script.py
   # More examples can be found under CodeToCAD/examples/
   from codetocad import *

   my_material = Material("material").set_color(169, 76, 181, 0.8)
   Part("Cube").create_cube(1, 1, 1).set_material(my_material)
   ```

3. Watch as your code gets seemlessly translated into CAD using our [custom addon](#working-with-the-software-of-your-choice) for your desired application

![Material Cube](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeToCAD/CodeToCAD/develop/docs/images/material_cube.png)

4. You may also run `codetocad my_codetocad_script.py` from the CLI to run your script.

> Above is the above script being run in blender using our [Blender Addon](#blender) below.

> Warning: Since CodeToCAD scripts are written and executed in Python, be careful when running scripts you find on the internet!
