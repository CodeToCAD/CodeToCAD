## Table of Contents

Use one python script to interact with all these software:
1. [Getting Started](#getting-started)
2. [Supported Applications](#supported-applications)


## Getting started

> Pre-requisites: Python 3.10 or newer.

1. Install the [CodeToCAD PIP Package](https://pypi.org/project/CodeToCAD/) to get intellisense syntax highlighting.

   ```
   pip install CodeToCAD
   ```

2. Create your own CodeToCAD python file and save it:

   ```python
   # my_codetocad_script.py
   # More examples can be found under CodeToCAD/examples/
   from codetocad import *

   my_material = Material("material").set_color(169, 76, 181, 0.8)
   Part("Cube").create_cube(1, 1, 1).set_material(my_material)
   ```

3. Watch as your code gets seemlessly translated into CAD

Above is the above script being run in blender using our [Blender Addon](#blender) below.


## Supported applications

<sub>* Alpha/Beta support
** Pre-alpha development.
*** To be developed.</sub>

## BLENDER

> Pre-requisites: Blender 3.1 or newer is required.

1. Download a release and install the Blender Addon from [CodeToCADBlenderAddon.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeToCAD/CodeToCAD/develop/CodeToCADBlenderAddon.zip) or from the latest Release (see the sidebar).

   > If you're a developer, instead of downloading a release, you can clone this repository. [Video Guide](https://youtu.be/YD_4nj0QUJ4)

2. Import your script using the file menu > import > CodeToCAD or the CodeToCAD menu in the sidebar.
   ![import_file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeToCAD/CodeToCAD/develop/docs/images/import_file_in_blender.png)

> Note, you can also run CodeToCAD in Blender via cli: `blender -- --codetocad $(pwd)/yourScript.py`

## WHAT DO I DO NEXT?

### WARNING!

Since CodeToCAD scripts are written and executed in Python, be careful when running scripts you find on the internet!

## THE POWER OF CODE-BASED CAD

</div>


Benefits of code-based modeling with CodeToCAD:

âœ… Simplified modeling interface - it's all text! No more scrolling and clicking into sub-menus to edit your models.

ðŸ”“ Not vendor locked - your models are created in an open-source language. If you want to use another software, you do not lose the features you have defined. Note: There is no guarantee that a model created for, e.g. Blender, will work right away for another software, but with some refactoring, it theoretically should!

ðŸª¶ Lightweight and portable. All you need is a text-editor to model. You can occasionally fire-up your modeling software to run your creations.

ðŸ’ª Leverages existing programming languages, like Python. You can keep using the languages you're familiar with and love. There is no one-off language you and your team has to learn. Use CodeToCAD like a library or a framework.

ðŸš¦Easy version control. Your models are written in code, you can use industry-loved git to keep track of versions of your models.

ðŸ’• Built by people who believe in automation and that modeling workflows should be intuitive, reliable and most importantly free and open source!
