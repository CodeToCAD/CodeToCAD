# CodeToCAD Core

The Core module contains the interface (non-implementation) details and enumerations of CodeToCAD, as well as generic utilities.

## Providers 

CodeToCAD interfaces are abstract and must be implemented by Providers to be useable.

For example, if you want to use CodeToCAD's Part class in Blender, you should first implement [blender_provider's](../providers/blender/) Part class, implementing PartInterface.

## Capabilities

[capabilities.json](./capabilities.json) contains all the "actions" that CodeToCAD is expected to perform.

### Code-generation from capabilities.json using JINJA2

CodeToCAD files under the following directories are autogenerated:

- [interfaces](./interfaces/)
- [provider_sample](./provider_sample/)
- [tests_interfaces](./tests_interfaces/)

#### Python Code Auto-Generation explanation:

Nesting in capabilities.json is formatted like this:
    className > methods > properties > parameters/information > definitions

E.g.:
    "Part": => className
        "information": => a method
            "Capabilities related to...",
        "constructor": { => a method
            "parameters": => a property
                {"name": => a parameter
                    {"type": "string"} => a definition
                },
        },
        "fromFile": { => a method
            "information": => a property
                "Create a shape from a file.",
            "parameters": => a property
                {"filePath": => a parameter
                    {"type": "string"}, => a definition
                "fileType": => a parameter
                    {"type": "string", "required": false} => a definition
                }
        }

The jinja2 templates reference this structure to build python classes and methods.
